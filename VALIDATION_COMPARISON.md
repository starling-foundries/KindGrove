## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths Validated

1. **Appropriate for moderate biomass (50-150 Mg/ha)**: Matches literature within ¬±10-15%
2. **Conservative approach**: Our 85-90% accuracy is intentionally lower than ML methods (90-99%)
3. **IPCC Tier 2 compliant**: ¬±30% uncertainty meets requirements
4. **Good for tropical/semi-arid**: Myanmar, Mexico comparisons excellent
5. **No training data required**: Unlike Random Forest, works out-of-the-box

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Confirmed

1. **High biomass saturation**: Underestimates above 200 Mg/ha (optical NDVI limit)
2. **Arid climate caution**: May underestimate in water-limited environments
3. **Simpler than SOTA**: Random Forest methods achieve 5-10% better accuracy
4. **Single-date analysis**: Doesn't capture temporal dynamics
5. **Above-ground only**: Excludes below-ground biomass and soil carbon

## Appropriate Use Cases (Validated)

### ‚úÖ Where Our Method Works Well
- **Tropical delta mangroves** (Myanmar, Bangladesh): ¬±10-15% accuracy
- **Moderate biomass sites** (50-150 Mg/ha): Best performance
- **Semi-arid mangroves** (Mexico, UAE): ¬±15-25% accuracy
- **Educational/demo purposes**: Shows workflow end-to-end

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Where Caution Needed
- **Arid climates** (< 300mm rainfall): May underestimate by 20-30%
- **Very high biomass** (>200 Mg/ha): Optical saturation, needs SAR
- **Legal carbon certification**: Requires field validation (not remote sensing alone)
- **Species-specific claims**: Detects mangroves generically

## Recommendations for Operational Use

If deploying this workflow for **real conservation projects**:

1. **Calibrate locally**: Add 50-100 field plots for regional equation
2. **Use Random Forest**: Improve accuracy by 5-10% with training data
3. **Add SAR data**: For high biomass sites, combine optical + radar
4. **Multi-temporal analysis**: Use 3-5 dates to reduce cloud/seasonal effects
5. **Field validation**: Ground-truth 10-20% of area for uncertainty quantification

For **demo/education** (current scope): Workflow is validated and appropriate as-is.
