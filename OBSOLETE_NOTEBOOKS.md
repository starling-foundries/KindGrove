# Obsolete Notebook Archive Log

This document tracks development iterations that led to the final `mangrove_workflow.ipynb`.

## Development History

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Sept 23)
**mangrove_simple.ipynb** (15MB)
- Purpose: First attempt at basic mangrove detection
- Issues: Densitymapbox deprecation warnings, large file size from embedded outputs
- Key learning: Need to use modern Plotly components

**mangrove_simple_fixed.ipynb** (14KB)
- Purpose: Fixed Plotly deprecation issues
- Issues: Still not interactive enough, lacked widget controls
- Key learning: Need ipywidgets for better user experience

**mangrove_biomass_demo.ipynb** (166KB)
- Purpose: Added biomass estimation logic
- Issues: Too many print statements, not "notebook-like"
- Key learning: Users prefer visual feedback over console output

**mangrove_biomass_visualization.ipynb** (12MB)
- Purpose: Enhanced visualization experiments
- Issues: Over-engineered, large file size
- Key learning: Simpler is better

**mangrove_maplibre.ipynb** (17KB)
- Purpose: Attempted MapLibre GL JS integration
- Issues: Complexity of JS/Python bridge, authentication confusion
- Key learning: Stay with pure Python stack (Plotly)

### Phase 2: Refinement (Sept 25-28)
**mangrove_working.ipynb** (11KB)
- Purpose: Streamlined workflow with working STAC integration
- Issues: Missing interactive controls, not ready for demo
- Key learning: Need progressive disclosure with buttons

**mangrove_MINIMAL_TUESDAY.ipynb** (9.3MB)
- Purpose: Major refactor for OGC demo deadline
- Issues: Still too complex, large outputs
- Key learning: Focus on 5-step workflow

### Phase 3: Final Implementation (Sept 29)
**mangrove_workflow.ipynb** (27KB) ✅
- Purpose: Production-ready interactive workflow
- Features:
  - Progressive 5-step workflow with buttons
  - Isopleth/contour biomass visualization
  - STAC-based open data access (no API keys)
  - Research-validated methods (Myanmar studies)
  - Clean outputs, minimal prints
  - CSV export functionality
- Status: **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**

## Key Technical Evolution

1. **Visualization**: Densitymapbox → Scattermap → Contour/Isopleth
2. **Interaction**: Print statements → Widgets → Button-based workflow
3. **Data Access**: Google Earth Engine → AWS STAC (no auth)
4. **Methods**: Novel approaches → Published peer-reviewed methods
5. **Structure**: Linear execution → Progressive disclosure

## Files Archived

These notebooks are preserved in `archive/notebooks/` for reference:
- mangrove_simple.ipynb
- mangrove_simple_fixed.ipynb
- mangrove_biomass_demo.ipynb
- mangrove_biomass_visualization.ipynb
- mangrove_maplibre.ipynb
- mangrove_working.ipynb
- mangrove_MINIMAL_TUESDAY.ipynb

## Lessons Learned

1. **Keep outputs small**: Don't commit notebooks with large embedded data
2. **User experience matters**: Interactive widgets > print statements
3. **Open data wins**: No authentication = easier adoption
4. **Science first**: Use published methods, not novel algorithms
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Guide users through workflow with clear steps
6. **Simplicity scales**: 5 steps beats 15 nested functions
